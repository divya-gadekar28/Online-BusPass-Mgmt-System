# Online Bus Pass Management System

## Introduction

The Online Bus Pass Management System is a web application designed to automate and manage bus pass issuance and validation processes. This project aims to streamline the management of bus passes for public transport systems, making it easier for both passengers and administrators.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can create accounts and log in securely.
- **Bus Pass Application**: Users can apply for new bus passes online.
- **Pass Validation**: Conductors or authorities can validate bus passes through the system.
- **User Dashboard**: Users can view the status of their bus passes, renew them, and see their travel history.
- **Admin Panel**: Administrators can manage users, bus pass applications, and view system analytics.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Client-side scripting to handle user interactions and dynamic content.

### Backend
- **Java Spring Boot**: Framework for building the backend RESTful API services.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system to store user data, pass details, and other information.
- **Tomcat Server**: Application server used to deploy and run the Java Spring Boot application.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- JDK 11 or higher
- Apache Maven
- MySQL Server

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bus-pass-management-system.git
    cd bus-pass-management-system
    ```

2. **Configure the database**:
    - Create a MySQL database named `bus_pass_db`.
    - Update the `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory with your database credentials.

    ```

3. **Run the development server** (if using a frontend build tool like webpack or create-react-app):
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Deployment

- Ensure that the backend Spring Boot application is running on the Tomcat server.
- Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
